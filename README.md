## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**I am a passionate and user-centric **UX/UI Designer** currently expanding my technical expertise by studying **Web Development at MIUN (Mid Sweden University)**. This blend of design passion and coding knowledge allows me to bridge the gap between aesthetics and technical feasibility, ensuring designs are not only beautiful but also practical to implement.

My primary focus is on creating intuitive, aesthetically pleasing, and highly functional digital experiences that solve real-world user problems.

**My Key Strengths & Skills Include:**

* **User Empathy & Research (UX Strategy):** A deep understanding of user needs, backed by solid methodologies in user research, interviews, and usability testing to define core user journeys.
* **Visual Fidelity (UI Design):** Proficiency in crafting clean, modern, and consistent visual designs that adhere to brand guidelines, enhance user engagement, and maintain accessibility standards.
* **Information Architecture & Prototyping:** Expert skills in mapping complex user flows, wireframing, and building interactive, high-fidelity prototypes (using tools like Figma) to validate design solutions efficiently.
* **Bridging Design & Code:** I leverage my developing knowledge in front-end technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) to communicate effectively with developers and create design systems that are scalable and component-based.
* **Collaboration:** A strong collaborator with cross-functional teams (developers, product managers, and stakeholders) to ensure design vision translates into successful, cohesive products.
